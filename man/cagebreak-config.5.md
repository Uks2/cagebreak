cagebreak-config(1) "Version 1.8.3" "Cagebreak Manual"

# NAME

*cagebreak-config* â€” Cagebreak config file

# SYNOPSIS

*\$XDG_CONFIG_PATH/cagebreak/config*

# DESCRIPTION

The cagebreak configuration file is a simple plain text file which configures
the way cagebreak behaves.
Each line constitutes a separate command which is parsed
independently from the rest of the file. Comments can be added
by prepending a line with the # symbol.

## COMMANDS

*abort*
	Return to the default mode without running any command

*background - Set background color*
	Set the background color. This command expects three floating point numbers
	between 0 and 1, specifying the r, g and b values respectively.
	(e.g. "background 1.0 0.0 0.0" sets to background color to red)
	There is no support for specifying a background image.

*bind - Bind key to command in root mode*
	This command requires a key (see *KEY DEFINITIONS*) and a command (see *COMMANDS*) as an argument.
	Subsequently, pressing this key while in command mode executes the
	supplied action. bind <key> <command> is equivalent to
		definekey root <key> <command>

*close - Close current window*
	This command closes the current window. It may be useful for windows of applications which
	do not offer any method of closing them.

*definekey - Bind key to action in arbitrary mode*
	This command behaves similarly to the *bind* command with the
	difference that the mode in which the keybinding is activated is
	specified by the user. A call to this function is to be structured as follows:

		definekey <mode> <key> <command>

*definemode*
	This command requires a single argument; the name of the mode to be defined.
	Subsequent to a call to this function, the defined mode may be used along with
	the definekey command to create a custom key mapping. Synopsis:

		definemode <mode>

*escape*
	Defines the key with which the current mode can be changed to "root".
	escape <key> is equivalent to definekey top <key> switch_mode root

*exchangedown*
	Exchange the current window with the window in the tile to the bottom

*exchangeleft*
	Exchange the current window with the window in the tile to the left

*exchangeright*
	Exchange the current window with the window in the tile to the right

*exchangeup*
	Exchange the current window with the window in the tile to the top

*exec*
	Executes the supplied shell command using *sh -c "<command>"*. Synopsis:

		exec <command>

*focus*
	Focus next tile

*focusdown*
	Focus the tile to the bottom

*focusleft*
	Focus the tile to the left

*focusprev*
	Focus previous tile

*focusright*
	Focus the tile to the right

*focusup*
	Focus the tile to the top

*hsplit*
	Split current tile horizontally

*input <identifier> <setting> <value>*
	Set the setting "<setting>" to "<value>" for device "<identifier>". The identifier can either be "\*" (wildcard), of the form "type:<device_type>" or the identifier of the device as printed for example by *cagebreak -s*. The supported input types are
	- touchpad
	- pointer
	- keyboard
	- touch
	- tablet_tool
	- tablet_pad
	- switch

	Configurations are applied sequentially. Currently, only libinput devices may be configured. The available settings and their corresponding values are as follows:

	*accel_profile adaptive|flat*
		Sets the pointer acceleration profile for the specified input device.

	*calibration_matrix <6 space-separated floating point values>*
		Sets the calibration matrix.

	*click_method none|button_areas|clickfinger*
		Changes the click method for the specified device.

	*drag enabled|disabled*
		Enables or disables tap-and-drag for specified input device.

	*drag_lock enabled|disabled*
		Enables or disables drag lock for specified input device.

	*dwt enabled|disabled*
		Enables or disables disable-while-typing for the specified input device.

	*enabled|disabled|disabled_on_external_mouse*
		Enables or disables send_events for specified input device. Disabling
		send_events disables the input device.

	*left_handed enabled|disabled*
		Enables or disables left handed mode for specified input device.

	*middle_emulation enabled|disabled*
		Enables or disables middle click emulation.

	*natural_scroll enabled|disabled*
		Enables or disables natural (inverted) scrolling for the specified input
		device.

	*pointer_accel [<-1|1>]*
		Changes the pointer acceleration for the specified input device.

	*scroll_button disable|<event-code-or-name>*
		Sets the button used for scroll_method on_button_down. The button can
		be given as an event name or code, which can be obtained from *libinput
		debug-events*. If set to
		_disable_, it disables the scroll_method on_button_down.

	*scroll_factor <floating point value>*
		Changes the scroll factor for the specified input device. Scroll speed will
		be scaled by the given value, which must be non-negative.

	*scroll_method none|two_finger|edge|on_button_down*
		Changes the scroll method for the specified input device.

	*tap enabled|disabled*
		Enables or disables tap for specified input device.

	*tap_button_map lrm|lmr*
		Specifies which button mapping to use for tapping. _lrm_ treats 1 finger as
		left click, 2 fingers as right click, and 3 fingers as middle click. _lmr_
		treats 1 finger as left click, 2 fingers as middle click, and 3 fingers as
		right click.

*mode <mode>*
	Enter mode "<mode>". After a keybinding is processed, return to default mode

*movetonextscreen*
	Move the current window to the next screen

*movetoworkspace <n>*
	Move the currently focused window to the n-th workspace

*next*
	Focus next window in current tile

*nextscreen*
	Focus the next screen

*only*
	Remove all splits and make the current window fill the entire screen

*output <name> [[pos <xpos> <ypos> res <width>x<height> rate <rate>] | enable | disable]*
	Configure the output "<name>". <xpos> and <ypos> are the position of the monitor
	in pixels. The top-left monitor should have the coordinates 0 0. <width> and
	<height> specify the resolution in pixels and <rate> sets the refresh rate of
	the monitor (often this is 50 or 60). The options enable and disable
	enable or disable the output <name>. Note that if <output> is the only enabled
	output, *output <output> disable* has no effect.

*prev*
	Focus previous window in current tile

*prevscreen*
	Focus the previous screen

*quit*
	Exit cagebreak

*resizedown*
	Resize the current tile towards the bottom

*resizeleft*
	Resize the current tile towards the left

*resizeright*
	Resize the current tile towards the right

*resizeup*
	Resize the current tile towards the top

*show_info*
	Display info about the current setup. In particular, print the identifiers
	of the available inputs and outputs.

*setmode <mode>*
	Set the default mode to <mode>

*switchvt <n>*
	Switch to tty n

*time*
	Display time

*vsplit*
	Split current tile vertically

*workspace <n>*
	Change to the n-th workspace

*workspaces*
	Requires a single integer larger than 1 and less than 30 as an argument. Sets the number of
	workspaces to the supplied number

# MODES

By default, three modes are defined:

*top*
	The default mode. Keybindings defined in this mode can be accessed
	directly, without the use of an escape key.

*root*
	The command mode. Keybindings defined in this mode can be accessed
	after pressing the key defined by the *escape* command.

*resize*
	Resize mode. This mode is used for resizing tiles.

# KEY DEFINITIONS

Keys are specified by their names as displayed for example by *xev*.
In addition, modifiers can be specified using the following syntax:

	<mod>-<key>

The supported modifiers are:

*A - Alt*

*C - Control*

*L - Logo*

*S - Shift*

*2 - Mod2*

*3 - Mod 3*

*5 - Mod 5*

For example to specify the keybinding Control+t, the expression:

	C-t

is used.
