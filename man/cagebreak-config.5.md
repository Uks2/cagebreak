% CAGEBREAK-CONFIG(1) Version 1.3.2 | Cagebreak Manual

# NAME

**cagebreak-config** â€” Cagebreak config file

# SYNOPSIS

**\$XDG_CONFIG_PATH/cagebreak/config**

# DESCRIPTION

The `cagebreak` configuration file is a simple plain text file which configures
the way `cagebreak` behaves.
Each line constitutes a separate command which is parsed
independently from the rest of the file. Comments can be added
by prepending a line with the # symbol.

## COMMANDS

**abort**

> Return to the default mode without running any command

**background - Set background color**

> Set the background color. This command expects three floating point numbers
> between 0 and 1, specifying the r, g and b values respectively.
> (e.g. "background 1.0 0.0 0.0" sets to background color to red)
> There is no support for specifying a background image.

**bind - Bind key to command in root mode**

> This command requires a key (see **KEY DEFINITIONS**) and a command (see **COMMANDS**) as an argument.
> Subsequently, pressing this key while in command mode executes the
> supplied action. `bind <key> <command>` is equivalent to
>> `definekey root <key> <command>`

**definekey - Bind key to action in arbitrary mode**

> This command behaves similarly to the **bind** command with the
> difference that the mode in which the keybinding is activated is
> specified by the user. A call to this function is to be structured as follows:
>
>> `definekey <mode> <key> <command>`

**definemode**

> This command requires a single argument; the name of the mode to be defined.
> Subsequent to a call to this function, the defined mode may be used along with
> the definekey command to create a custom key mapping. Synopsis:
>
>> `definemode <mode>`

**escape**

> Defines the key with which the current mode can be changed to "root".
> `escape <key>` is equivalent to `definekey top <key> switch_mode root`

**exchangedown**

> Exchange the current window with the window in the tile to the bottom

**exchangeleft**

> Exchange the current window with the window in the tile to the left

**exchangeright**

> Exchange the current window with the window in the tile to the right

**exchangeup**

> Exchange the current window with the window in the tile to the top

**exec**

> Executes the supplied shell command using *`sh -c "<command>"`*. Synopsis:
>
>> `exec <command>`

**focus**

> Focus next tile

**focusdown**

> Focus the tile to the bottom

**focusleft**

> Focus the tile to the left

**focusprev**

> Focus previous tile

**focusright**

> Focus the tile to the right

**focusup**

> Focus the tile to the top

**hsplit**

> Split current tile horizontally

**mode <mode>**

> Enter mode "`<mode>`". After a keybinding is processed, return to default mode

**movetonextscreen**

> Move the current window to the next screen

**movetoworkspace <n>**

> Move the currently focused window to the n-th workspace

**next**

> Focus next window in current tile

**nextscreen**

> Focus the next screen

**only**

> Remove all splits and make the current window fill the entire screen

**output <name> pos <xpos> <ypos> res <width>x<height> rate <rate>**

> Configure the output "<name>". <xpos> and <ypos> are the position of the monitor
> in pixels. The top-left monitor should have the coordinates 0 0. <width> and
> <height> specify the resolution in pixels and <rate> sets the refresh rate of
> the monitor (often this is 50 or 60).

**prev**

> Focus previous window in current tile

**prevscreen**

> Focus the previous screen

**quit**

> Exit cagebreak

**resizedown**

> Resize the current tile towards the bottom

**resizeleft**

> Resize the current tile towards the left

**resizeright**

> Resize the current tile towards the right

**resizeup**

> Resize the current tile towards the top

**setmode <mode>**

> Set the default mode to `<mode>`

**switchvt <n>**

> Switch to tty n

**time**

> Display time

**vsplit**

> Split current tile vertically

**workspace <n>**

> Change to the n-th workspace

**workspaces**

> Requires a single integer larger than 1 and less than 30 as an argument. Sets the number of
> workspaces to the supplied number

# MODES

By default, three modes are defined:

**top**

> The default mode. Keybindings defined in this mode can be accessed
> directly, without the use of an escape key.

**root**

> The command mode. Keybindings defined in this mode can be accessed
> after pressing the key defined by the `escape` command.

**resize**

> Resize mode. This mode is used for resizing tiles.

# KEY DEFINITIONS

Keys are specified by their names as displayed for example by *`xev`*.
In addition, modifiers can be specified using the following syntax:

> `<mod>-<key>`

The supported modifiers are:

**A - Alt**

**C - Control**

**L - Logo**

**S - Shift**

**2 - Mod2**

**3 - Mod 3**

**5 - Mod 5**

For example to specify the keybinding Control+t, the expression:

>`C-t`

is used.
