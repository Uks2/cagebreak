# NAME

**cagebreak** â€” A Wayland tiling compositor to the likes of ratpoison

# SYNOPSIS

| **cagebreak** [OPTIONS]

# DESCRIPTION

`cagebreak` is a slim, keyboard-controlled, tiling compositor for
wayland conceptually based on the X11 window manager `ratpoison`.

It allows for the screen to be split into non-overlapping tiles and,
in contrast to the original `ratpoison`, has native support for
multi-workspace operation.

All interactions between the user and `cagebreak` are done via
the keyboard. Configuration of this behaviour is specified
in the **\$XDG_CONFIG_PATH/cagebreak/config** file (See **cagebreak-config(5)**).
