# Bugs

This file is slightly unusual to exist given that the project is currently
developed on github which offers an issue tracker. However, documenting
bugs inside of the repository makes the project more robust, should it ever
be moved to another hosting provider with a different issue tracking approach
or in case of network outages, where the github issue tracker may be unavailable
for developers. It also makes possible the description of bugs which were not
submitted on the issue tracker, should any other forms of contact become
available.
